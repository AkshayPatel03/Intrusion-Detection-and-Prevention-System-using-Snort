# Snort Installation Guide on Kali Linux

This guide outlines the steps to install and configure Snort, an open-source network intrusion detection system (NIDS) and network intrusion prevention system (NIPS), on a Kali Linux system.

## Step 1: Update Your System
First, ensure your system is up to date by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary development libraries and tools required for building and compiling Snort and its dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential \
  autotools-dev \
  libdumbnet-dev \
  libluajit-5.1-dev \
  libpcap-dev \
  zlib1g-dev \
  pkg-config \
  libhwloc-dev \
  cmake \
  liblzma-dev \
  openssl \
  libssl-dev \
  cpputest \
  libsqlite3-dev \
  libtool \
  uuid-dev \
  git \
  autoconf \
  bison \
  flex \
  libcmocka-dev \
  libnetfilter-queue-dev \
  libunwind-dev \
  libmnl-dev \
  ethtool \
  libjemalloc-dev
```

### Explanation of Dependencies: (Optional to know, This is for better understanding)
- `build-essential`: Essential development tools including the GCC compiler and `make`.
- `autotools-dev`: Tools for generating configuration scripts for software.
- `libdumbnet-dev`: Provides low-level networking routines.
- `libluajit-5.1-dev`: LuaJIT for Lua scripting.
- `libpcap-dev`: Network packet capture library.
- `zlib1g-dev`: Compression library.
- `pkg-config`: Helper tool for compiling applications and libraries.
- `libhwloc-dev`: Abstraction library for hierarchical architectures.
- `cmake`: Cross-platform build automation tool.
- `liblzma-dev`: XZ and LZMA compression library.
- `openssl`, `libssl-dev`: Secure communication libraries.
- `cpputest`: C/C++ test framework.
- `libsqlite3-dev`: SQLite 3 library for database management.
- `libtool`: Generic library support script.
- `uuid-dev`: Library for generating unique identifiers.
- `git`: Version control system.
- `autoconf`: Tool for generating configuration scripts.
- `bison`, `flex`: Tools for generating parsers and lexical analyzers.
- `libcmocka-dev`: Unit testing library.
- `libnetfilter-queue-dev`: Handling packets queued by the kernel packet filter.
- `libunwind-dev`: Library for determining the call-chain of a program.
- `libmnl-dev`: Minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
- `ethtool`: Utility for examining and tuning network interface settings.
- `libjemalloc-dev`: Efficient memory allocator library.

## Step 3: Download and Install Snort
Download the Snort source code from the [Snort downloads page](https://www.snort.org/downloads).

To install Snort, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install snort
```

## Conclusion
By following the above steps, you will ensure that your system has all the necessary components to compile and run Snort effectively. Without these dependencies, Snort may not be able to capture or analyze network traffic, compile its source code, or perform other essential tasks.

For more detailed instructions and additional configuration options, refer to the official [Snort documentation](https://www.snort.org/documents).
